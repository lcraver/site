This is the home of the source files of my website: built using [Grunt]() & [Assemble]() and deployed on the best bucket on Amazon S3. I open-sourced the files for my site so you can learn how my site is built and the processes I used to get there. Eventually I will document these processes, but for now I deciced open-source would be the best way to go.
