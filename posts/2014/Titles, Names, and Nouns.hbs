On April 14, Brad Frost published an article titled "Creatives". Within this article he explained why one shouldn't go around calling themselves a creative.

I agree completely and would like to take this a bit further.

Many of us do not have jobs or roles that we can describe in one word. We can't just get off easy when someone asks us what we do and say that we are a doctor, dentist, or mechanic. Our jobs are not necessarily ordinary enough for us to just give the title. I can't just say "I am a designer" without someone wondering what I do. Often times I have to give my title and biefly descibe myself: "I am a designer; I build websites and make graphics."

So that might descibe my role, but of course everyone will immediately wonder if you make a living off that, or in my case as a student, if you will make a living *designing* in my future. 

"Oh so what have you done?"

As Austin Kleon puts in his book *Show Your Work* this is the veiled question of "Do you actually make any money doing that?"

Here we go again...

So we all know that yes we do make money being designers, wether it is for the web or for print. 

We make good money **because we are creative people**. 

Wether you consider creative the ability to draw swirly graphics, or creative the ability to solve a problems, or both, everyone who designs is in some way, shape, or form, creative. They can solve problems and pocess the ability to make work unlike other poeople. This group of peoeple is very creative. Everything they do is creative. They are a creative person. 

They are a creative.

No. They aren't actually.

They are not a creative.

Creative is adjective and it is not a noun.

**The work one *does* is creative work.**

You can not *be* a creative; you can be a creative person, yes, but you can not be *a creative*.

When, like myself, you are in school, you have an architecture major beacause you want to become an architect; the computer science major will maybe become a developer or an enineer; the medical school grad will go on to become a doctor; these majors all have a clear vison of what they will do with their major, but what about the graphic design major?

The designer does not have a clear purpose. They can do many things. From web to print, to motion grapics to photography, usually your average designer has dabbled in all these areas in some way.

To make maters more complicated, most of us write and speak. Wether it be blogs or books, meetups or conferences, most of us play some role in sharing our opinions and ideas with those who do work like us. This makes us very different from any other industry and it is something that many in the industry treasure. 

For this reason our roles are complex, but at the core, we are a creation factory. We create things and ideas and what we do is creative.

However, we are not *creatives*.

Each of us has a specific role to play, but it is not as a creative. It is as a writer, as a designer, as a developer, as an artist â€”it is as a person who contributes amazing work to the world. Be entirely honest about what you do. If people question your title, grasp that oppurtunity to share with them your work. They will be jealous of what you do, I promise.
