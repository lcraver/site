Early this year I became fully aware of the fact that no longer found it important to scroll through my news feed on Facebook. I was perfectly content with Twitter and Instagram being my primary sources of social media. Looking around at others, I realized I was not the only person my age avoiding their Facebook news feed. I began asking questions. Why do we avoid looking at and interacting with our Facebook news feeds? What is it that it lacks? What can Facebook do to fix it? 

##Looking at the Problem
I think a good start would be to stop asking me to like Doritos and Coca-Cola pages every other post because “Billy Bob Joe and three other friends” like it. They thought it would be great to be innovative to add hashtags (oh wait) and trending topics. Looks like that worked out well.
I won’t rant about the problems Facebook has, rather I like to look at a success story: Twitter. It makes me happy just to think of scrolling through my news feed. Why? Well first off, I have control over everything I see. All the people I follow have mutual interests and post content I like. If they start posting one too many #selfiesunday pictures (well all love hashtags, right?), then I unfollow them. 

Moreover, Twitter doe not have a creepy storage of everything I have done in my life. If I do not provide my profile with something, it doesn’t scream at me, “We need your elementary school name.” All I need is a short bio, a profile photo, and a cover photo. If I want to, I can add a website link and a location. 
Now, Twitter isn’t perfect, but there is one social media platform that did it: Google+. Google has a tendency to do it right. With their philosophies it is a wonder they don’t own Facebook by now. 
Everything is under control. There are no freaking ads. For perks, the user interface is beautiful. It is easy to control public and private settings. 

##Solving the problem
I don’t own Facebook and I ain’t Mark Zuckeburg, however, I made a visual strategic and rebranding plan for the new Facebook which includes my radical ideas on how to fix the social media giant. Checkout the project on [Behance]() and [download the book]().
