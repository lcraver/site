Earlier this week I was messing around in the Chrome dev tools and got curious about the "Enable CSS Source Maps" feature. After a few hours of tinkering, I got a pretty good understanding of what CSS source maps are and how they work intro the workflow of a front-end developer who uses preprocessors like Sass and LESS together with taskrunners: in my case  LESS + Grunt. 

If you use a preprocessor, imagine your typical setup. 

You probably have a ton of partials containing specific code for specific features, e.g., typography code is in a typography partial and nav bar code is in a nav bar partial; this is pretty typical. You probably also use either Grunt or Gulp to concatenate these partials into some minified, compressed `styles.min.css`file ready for production. 

This workflow works very well, but let's say you have an issue/bug and open up dev tools to inspect it.

The source file will of-course be listed as `styles.min.css` and since everything is minified, Chrome tell you the rule is on line one, along with every other rule; if you click on this link, dev tools will take you to the "source document" so you can see it.

However, this unhelpful, minified stylesheet is really not the source; rather, it is the LESS or Sass files it was compiled from that is the source. 

Wouldn't it be helpful if we could see that in dev tools instead?

**Enter, source map**.

Source maps allows you to see that code. It has been around for a while in Chrome, but only recently did the `grunt-contrib-sass` and `grunt-contrib-less` plugins receive the updates to support it. 


## What is this wizardry.
Essentially, the source map feature connects, within dev tools, your production stylesheet to your source stylesheet(s); it does this magic through a comment at the bottom of the production stysheet and a `*.css.map` file.

```css
/*# sourceMappingURL=styles.css.map */
```

#### The Map File
The `*.css.map` file, which usually has the same name as the stylesheet it is mapped to, is a JSON document that contains information Chrome uses to link the two stylesheets together. When you use Grunt, this file is generated automatically, but it is still good to understand what all the values are.

```json
{
  "version": "3",
  "file": "styles.css",
  "sourceRoot": "",
  "mappings": "AaBCd, BAd, A55",
  "sources": [ "typography.less", "grid.less" ],
  "names": [ ... ],
}
```

1. `version`: Version number the source map is based off.
2. `file`: Filename of the production stylesheet.
3. `mappings`: [Base64 VLQ](#further-reading) values used to map values.
4. `sourceRoot`: Prepend sources with a folder structure.
5. `sources`: URLS to the partials used.
6. `names`: Array containing variable/method names.

#### Grunt Setup
Now that you understand how source mapping works, it's time to turn it on. For both the `grunt-contrib-sass` and `grunt-contrib-less` plugins, it is just a matter of adding a few lines to your `options` for those tasks. 

```js
less || sass: { 
  options: {
    sourceMap: true,
    outputSourceFiles: true,
    sourceMapFilename: 'css/styles.css.map',
    sourceMapURL: 'http://localhost:8000/dist/development/assets/css/styles.css.map',
    sourceMapRootpath: 'http://localhost:8000'
  }
}
```
These are generally the only options you need to set to get everything working properly; they will first turn on the source map generator and then instruct the generator what to do. 

`sourceMapFilename` is the filename and locaton of the generated map; I usually put the source map file in the same folder as the stylesheet.

The URL used in the comment within the production stylesheet, e.g. `/*# sourceMappingURL= (sourceMapURL) */`, is specified though the `sourceMapURL` option; generally, you want to use a full URL with `http://` to avoid any isues with Chrome not being able to locate the file. 

`sourceMapRootpath` is the value used for the `sourceRoot` property in the map. 

In some cases, you can get away with just setting `sourceMap` to true and not adding any of the other options, but this usually only works if you have a very simple gruntfile. 

Finally, ff these settings are for some reason not working for you, read the plugin documentation: [grunt-contrib-sass][3], [grunt-contrib-less][4].

## Further Reading 
- [An interesting article][2] on html5rocks by Ryan Seddon explains how the Base64 VLC encoding works.
- The Google Developers site has documentation on using Chrome to work with [pre-processors][1]. It covers how to setup source map as well as live reload.
- If you use Gulp, both the [Less][5] and the [Sass][6] support source maps as well.
