I am happy to say that over this past weekend and the last couple days week I have finished a ton of documentation; not everyone gets off a week of school for Mardi Gras (New Orleans for the win), so be jealous. 

You can find it all here:

- [Code styleguide](/styleguide)
- [Personal Colophon](/colophon)
- [Order of the Arrow Colophon and Post-Mortem](/portfolio/oabsa)

As always, if you want to make a change or contribution to any of these documents (*hint, hint*: the code styleguide) feel free to [make a pull-request](http://github.com/pburtchaell/site-assemble). 

It would be especially awesome if someone added a section on JavaScript styles; that would be glorious.
