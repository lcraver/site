### Software
[Brackets](http://brackets.io) - Over the past year I've switched between four code editors on my Windows machine. Brackets is by far my favorite because of its simple user-interface and number of extensions. [Adobe Edge Code]() is fork of Brackets maintained by Adobe. 

[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows) - A classic editor I use when I need to make a quick edit. The UI and highlighting isn't as nice on the eye as other editors, but it works in pinch. 

[Coda 2](http://panic.com/coda/) - (Mac OSX, $30) - While Coda 2 is somewhat expensive considering your free options it was really worth it. It is more of a powerhorse then any other code editor I use. Think of Dreamweaver, but for the modern web designer. It has built in shell, FTP, and Git. I really like using it when working on my MacBook Pro.

I use the [Git App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.romanenco.gitt&hl=en) (Android) and [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) &amp; [Github for Mac](http://mac.github.com/) for version control. I have also used [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (Mac OSX/Windows) for Git repositories not on Github, but I definitely perfer the Github GUI over any other application. It is simple and gets the job done. I also have a [Zenhub.io](https://www.zenhub.io/) acount, which is a nice app for Github that you can use to make managing issues better. Think Trello boards + Github issues = Zenhub.

[CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.net/) (iOS/Android) is a nice app for editing files on your phone via FTP.
[S3 Browser](http://s3browser.com/) is an application for uploading files to Amazon S3; I it like because of the HTTP header settings.

## Useful Front-End Tools
The front-end tools available now are amazing. Most of these tools, when used appropriate, do make processes flow better and I am glad to use them.

- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) &mdash; Taskrunner
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) &mdash; Taskrunner
- [Bower](http://bower.io/) &mdash; Package Mangement
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) &mdash; Grunt + Bower + Project Scaffolding

### Static Site Generators
- [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) &mdash; Works with JSON, YML, and Markdown
- [Cabin](http://www.cabinjs.com/)
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

### Content Mangement Systems
- [Ghost CMS](https://ghost.org/) &mdash; powerful, modern CMS using Handlebars
- [Harp Server](http://harpjs.com/) &mdash; static web server with built-in preprocessing.

### Libraries
- [Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/) &mdash; minimalist JavaScript library for modern browsers with a largely jQuery-compatible API
- [min.js](https://github.com/remy/min.js) &mdash; a super tiny JavaScript library to execute simple DOM querying 

### The Framework
- [Zurb Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/) &mdash; the best responsive design framework
- [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) &mdash; webapp framework that uses Handlebars

### Grunt Plugins &amp; Tutorials
It can be difficult to get a full understanding of Grunt at first. Here are a few plugins and tutorials to get you started

- ```npm install grunt-contrib``` &mdash; the master suite, everything you need to get started with Grunt
- ```npm install assemble``` &mdash; Assemble, static site generator
- ```npm install pretty``` &mdash; Code "prettifyer" for HTML
- ```npm install ```

### Gulp Plugins &amp; Tutorials
For your infomation: Gulp is an alternative to Grunt introduced recently. If you are not familiar with it or are unclear of of how it is different from Grunt, I reccomend reading the first two resources.

- [_Getting Started With Gulp_](http://markgoodyear.com/2014/01/getting-started-with-gulp) by Mark Goodyear
- [_Gulp: Streaming Build Systems_](http://slid.es/contra/gulp) by Eric Schoffstall 
- [Gulp Plugins](http://gratimax.github.io/search-gulp-plugins/)
