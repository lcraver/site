I finally have some time now to publish part of my undertaking for 2014, a little project that I creatively (or so I like to believe) call _Project 2014_. Project 2014 is a challenge I am giving myself this year to everyday make a small 1:1 graphic in under fifteen-minutes. These graphics will not be for the web, but instead for print. At the end of the year I hope to have 365 designs. If I am happy enough with my finished product, I will maybe print the book for fun for myself. In the meantime, I will share my progress on both [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/_pb) and [Behance](http://behance.net/burtchaell). When my schedule allows so, I will also post the graphics here on my website. 

I am taking the challenge of Project 2014 because I want to grow to become a better designer. I hope that these simple and short designs will serve as inspiration for my larger and more important projects. Of course, I also hope to gain technical experience and become more adapt with the processes and programs I use. I can already tell that after one week, Project 2014 will be a very rewarding experience for me. We will have to see where I am at the end of the year (only 347 more designs to go as of today).

## Week One
I recently read an interesting book titled _Meme Wars_. Even though it was a complete accident that I found this book at the library, it has been a very influencing read and I would definitely suggest that anyone interested in economics find a copy and read it.
