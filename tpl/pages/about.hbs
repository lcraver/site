I am a web designer and videographer from New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. I am currently a home schooled senior and also attend New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts as a Level IV student in the Media Arts department. Outside my studies, I work as a freelance web designer. 

I have a passion for telling stories and solving problems with design, video and audio. I have a passion for creating content that speaks for itself —content that gives a message to someone. Sometimes that content is in the form of a short film. Other times, it is in the form of a poster or a website. Ultimately, I want to be the person who takes abstract, organic ideas straight from the mind and objectify them –turn them into concrete, visual stories everyone can understand. I want to design graphics that stand out from the rest. I want to make videos that tell stories unlike any other. I want to write stories that fly off the paper. 

When I worked with the TED Talks video team at the 2013 TEDxYouth conference in New Orleans, we interviewed each speaker. “What is your spark?” was one of the questions asked. Many of them told us of a spark that was deep within them; one that fueled everything extraordinary they have ever done. I believe my desires for digital media creation is sparked by something deep within my core &mdash;that is, a fundamental desire for communication. 

My spark is one I believe I can never completely master –because honestly, who can perfectly master communication, even on a basic level? I won’t let this stop me though; I'll let you in on a little secret: I have already been living my passion for the past seventeen years. Now, it is time to capture my spark and unleash it within my work.
