I am a web designer and videographer, currently working as freelancer, from New Orleans. I have a passion for telling stories and solving problems with design, video and audio. I have a passion for creating content that speaks for itself —content that gives a message to someone. Sometimes that content is in the form of a short film. Other times, it is in the form of a poster or a website. Ultimately, I want to be the person who takes abstract, organic ideas straight from the mind and objectify them –turn them into concrete, visual stories everyone can understand. I want to design graphics that stand out from the rest. I want to make videos that tell stories unlike any other. I want to write stories that fly off the paper.
