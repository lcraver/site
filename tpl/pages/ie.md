#It looks like you are using Internet Explorer!

Let me tell you a quick little story:

Once upon a time, a web designer named Patrick was sitting in his warm bedroom sipping on a tea and writing code for his website. Patrick was very excite for his website: he was using great new techniques such as REM and flexbox. As he wrote this modern code, he tested the website in modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to make it was always working perfectly. To this web designer's delight, this code usually always worked in all these browsers. Occasionally, he would find an issue in one, but Patrick could always resolve that issue in a small amount of time. Life was good for the web designer. 

But not all good things last forever.

One day when the designer was busy coding at his desk he decided to open up Internet Explorer and test how well it supported his site. After hovering over the IE icon, catching a fever, and going down sick for days from just thinking about that idea, IE decided to open up IE three days later. 

Now this web designer has designed sites that support IE7 before; he knew what would happen -everything would be broken- but he also hoped that because of fastidious code he was written, perhaps that would not be the case.

Patrick discovered everything was broken.

And he was not surprised.

The footer was up under the header because he was using flex-box, a modern layout module fully supported in every other browser. The perfectly selected typefaces had warped into Times New Roman because the font-files were not supported for security reasons; apparently the WOFF files we too scandalous for good ole IE. His beautufil typography properties were worthless and his syntax highlighting script was deactivated. In fact, all Javascript in general was deacivated.

However, the web designer did not allow that to get to him. Instead he spent many hours attempting to fix everything. He knew he could do it; he knew the technologies, the shims, and the pollyfills that would answer all IE's problems and eccentricies. After this work was done, he finally had his site looking *acceptable* in Internet Explorer 9. Following in the paths of many, he decided he would not support IE8. He cringes at the thought of IE7 support.

Assuming that the newly released default browser of the modern, contemporary, solve-the-problems-of-the-world Windows 8.1 would support his website perfectly, perhaps even better than Chrome, the web designer opens his site up in IE11. To the rage of the poor web designer, his site looked worse in IE11 than it did in IE9. At this point, he could not stop thinking about how rediculous of an effort this was. He kept on thinking about how he could spend this time and effort on developing better, more worthwhile features for other web browsers. The web designer made a chart to visualize his efforts for IE support versus new features. 

Realizing he was completely wasting his time supporting IE and their incredulous development team, the web designer decided to give up all hope. After all, analylitics ad proven that only 2 percent of his visitors came from the waste-land of Internet Explorer. Why spend so much time for such a helpless group of users? Rather than to just leave his website broken for IE for the entierity of time (the web designer knew that the IE development team would enever catch up to the other browsers), he would try to save that selfless group of IE users. He would write a story and post it on his website. 

The web designer knew he could not save the turds in the punchbowl, er... the Internet Explorer users, but he could at-least warn them: "your browser sucks and you suck for using it and forcing me to support it.""
