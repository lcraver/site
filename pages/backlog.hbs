This document serves as a roadmap of features I plan to add to my site in the future. As features are added, the [changelog](http://pburtchaell.com/changelog) will be updated and the item crossed out from the backlog. If you are interested in taking a look at my code, it is open-sourced [on Github](http://github.com/pburtchaell/site-assemble).
